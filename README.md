# Toast

### Overview
This is a simple exercise to help you make perfect toast.

You make toast by using sliced bread and expose it to heat. 

The bread turns brown. This alters the flavour of the bread and makes it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. 

Bread is often toasted using a toaster. Oven grills can also used, but for this exercise, we will be using a toaster.

You can eat toast for breakfast or as a snack.

### Toasting process
Setting up
- Plug your toaster in and check it's switched on

Toasting
- Put your slices of bread next to the heat (this is usually a push down button)

Spreading and serving
Using your knife:

### Eating
Although toast is often eaten at breakfast, you can enjoy your toast any time of day.

Toast is so versatile, you can eat it at home with the family. Or, if you have a morning rush to work, you can eat it on the go.

### Try new toppings
Even though toast is quite simple, feel free to try new toppings. There are lots of different jams out there. Or you could try other spreads such as peanut butter or Nutella.
